    <p class=" text-white text-wrap">
        At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one <br> of Earth's closest habitable neighbors. Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is,<br> so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold, but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere <br> is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other <br> trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by <br> compressing the atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would <br> be able to lift heavy things and bound around. <br>Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.
